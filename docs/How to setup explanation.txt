1. Optional

Your antivirus might flag the .exe as suspicious.
To prevent this, add the original folder location of the .exe file (not the shortcut) to your antivirus program’s exception list.
Search YouTube for how to do this based on your antivirus.

2. Optional: Restart the app on every workstation unlock

To ensure EyeGuard.exe always runs fresh each time you log in or unlock your PC (and prevent multiple instances), set up a Task Scheduler entry as follows:

✅ Create the Scheduled Task
Search in Windows search bar "Task Scheduler" or press Win + R, type "taskschd.msc", and press Enter to open Task Scheduler.

In the right panel, click Create Task… (not Basic Task).

    General Tab:
        Name: EyeGuard.exe

        Check ✅: Run only when user is logged on

        Check ✅: Run with highest privileges


    Triggers Tab:
        Click New…

        Begin the task: On workstation unlock

        Click OK


    Actions Tab:
        Click New…

        Action: Start a program

        Program/script: powershell.exe

        Add arguments:
            (Copy the entire following line bellow and replace there 'C:\Full\Path\To\EyeGuard.exe' with the full absolute path to your .exe file.)
            -Command "Get-Process EyeGuard -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | ForEach-Object { $_.Kill() }; Start-Sleep -Seconds 2; Start-Process 'C:\Users\Sicaja\Desktop\DB\DB-Bussiness\2019.01.01_SmartCodeACADEMY\1.0_Projects\2025.12.15_PRJ_GitHub_PRJ_Eye-Guard\publish\EyeGuard.exe'"

        Press: OK

    Conditions Tab
        Uncheck ⛔: Stop if the computer switches to battery power


    Settings Tab
        Set:
        If the task is already running, then the following rule applies:
        ✅ Stop the existing instance

       Uncheck ⛔:
       Uncheck all except "Allow task to be run on the demand"

        Press: OK

Now you can lock and unlock your PC and this is it. You need to see pop-up window in the lower right part of you screen.
